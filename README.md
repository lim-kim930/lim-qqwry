# lim-qqwry

#### A json converter for qqwry.dat file.



## Installation

### LimMailer requires **Node.js v6.0.0** or higher for ES2015 and async function support.

```
npm install lim-qqwry
```

### Note that when creating a new instance, the module will read the .dat file into the memory to improve the speed of subsequent operations (extreme speed mode in the original code), so if it is a one-time conversion instead of query services, please pay attention to the memory overflow problem.
